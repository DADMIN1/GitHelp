# to show the current remotes
git remote -v

# clone your fork (as origin), then add the original repo as upstream:
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/ORIGINAL-REPOSITORY.git

# when you need to sync your fork with upstream, switch to your (fork) main branch, and merge like this:
git merge --ff upstream/main
