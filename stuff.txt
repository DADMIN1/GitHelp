note about the 'username' it asks you for during push:
it can either be your profile (displayed) name, or the actual account-name

notes about private repos:
if you make a repo private, it'll require authentication to fetch/pull, not just push

Licenses:
Apache
BSD
Boost


explain:
.gitignore

commit

fetch - updates history
pull - pulls in changes


always:
start with a clean slate
fetch before pull
pull and merge with --ff


pitfalls
.git folders cannot be moved/copied
remember, once a file has been committed, it's part of the repo forever.
    don't commit binaries/unnecessary files
